Hi - I'm Aurelium, I'm a Minecraft modder who mostly focuses on pushing the limits of the game by carefully tweaking its internal functions. I'm deeply experienced with both the Forge and Fabric modloaders. My most recent professional work is with SSundee's 1.12 modded series "Insane Craft", working with the main developer for the project to help deliver content in time for video releases.
