Hi - I'm Aurelium, I'm a software developer. Most of my professional (and much of my hobby) work so far has been working with people creating Minecraft content or running community servers to create new features and tweak game internals. I'm proficient with Java, Kotlin, Python, and Rust. I've worked with YouTubers like SSundee, BeckBroJack, and SystemZee to create game content for their videos.
